Excellent hotel with great staff!,01-2022,The room was very clean and there were some free snacks laid out for us on the bed. We felt very warmly welcomed. We stayed on New Year's Eve and surely felt a bit hungover the next day. The staff was very understanding and gave us extra time for our check out so that we were able to get some more sleep in. They even handed us some bottles of water for our car ride home when we checked out.
