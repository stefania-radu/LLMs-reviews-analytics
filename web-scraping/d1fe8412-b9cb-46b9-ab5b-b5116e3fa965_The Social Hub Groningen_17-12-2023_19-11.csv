Für diejenigen, die mit dem Auto anreisen - direkt neben dem Hotel ist ein Parkhaus, in dem man das Auto für 13,50 Euro pro Tag parken kann. Das ist für Groningen günstig!
Unser Zimmer fanden wir angemessen groß, aber schon etwas in die Jahre gekommen. 
Wir haben das Frühstück im Hotel gebucht. Es gab ein großes Frühstücksbüffet, mit dem wir sehr zufrieden waren und das seinen Preis (12,50 Euro pro Person) wert war. Holland ist teuer und für das Geld hätte man in den umliegenden Cafés deutlich weniger geboten bekommen... Abends kann man im Hotel auch Kleinigkeiten essen (haben wir nicht in Anspruch genommen) oder an der Bar was trinken.
Am Besten gefallen hat uns aber das sehr freundliche und hilfsbereite Personal! Jede Frage wurde beantwortet und bei Schwierigkeiten nach Lösungen gesucht.","Unser Zimmer war bei unserer Ankunft nicht richtig sauber - das darf meines Erachtens bei dem Preis (ca. 105 Euro pro Übernachtung) nicht sein!! Wir haben dann als Entschädigung einen Frühstücksgutschein bekommen, fanden das Zimmer aber insgesamt etwas runtergerockt. Der Teppichboden (geht gar nicht!) war deutlich in die Jahre gekommen, im Bad gab es keinen Föhn, Bügel fehlten und es gab keine Steckdosen neben dem Bett. Am Schlimmsten war die Dusche - einmal duschen und das Bad war geflutet. Hier gibt es unseres Erachtens Handlungsbedarf!!",False

De badkamer is ingericht op een mindervalide persoon (stoel in de douche hoek en leuningen op de toilet etc). De “luxe” badkamer van de foto’s was er totaal niet in terug te zien. Aanvankelijk hadden we een badkamer die enorm stonk naar riolering. Toen kregen we een nieuwe kamer (met moeite) en die bleek ook een mindervalide badkamer te hebben. Reactie van het hotel was dat dat hun grote kamers zijn. Groter staat dus niet garant voor meer comfort.
